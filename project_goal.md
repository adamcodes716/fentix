These directions are for copilot.
This is a project coded by someone else.  I am trying to take this project and make some improvements to it.  Please exhaustively understand the docs in the "docs" folder, the readme.md, and the code itself.  
1.  Allow for the use of a separate ollama service.  On my network, I am running ollama at 192.168.1.100.  I want to use this ollama service and NOT spin up a new one here.
2. I want to move this to a docker container
3. I still want to be able to pull source code from the source repo that I do not own. I know this might be difficult - I'd like to make this low priority.
